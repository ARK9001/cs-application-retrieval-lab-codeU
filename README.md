## learning goal 
Students can use the sort algorithms in the Arrays class; they understand how quicksort works (and possibly insertion sort), and they can implement merge sort.

## notes
What to sort by? Look up word x, get back list of URLS and get how many times the word shows up on those pages. Sorted by most common/least common etc. First iteration would be to use just Arrays.sort. Then maybe move into MergeSort
